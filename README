To compile everything: 

cd binding/java

JXTA-SOAP based on JXTA J2SE:
ant core.j2se
ant jar.j2se

These commands generate jxtasoap.jar

JXTA-SOAP based on JXME (CDC proxyless):
ant core.cdc
ant jar.cdc

These commands generate jxmesoap.jar

A good starting point to see how things work is the example in
/examples subdir (only for JXTA-SOAP based on JXTA J2SE).
