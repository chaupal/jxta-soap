To compile JXTA-SOAP CDC version: 

Go to the soap.cdc directory and run

ant soap.cdc
ant project.jar

These commands generate a soap.cdc-2.5.jar file in the build/ folder.


A good starting point to see how things work for CDC version of the project is basic.server.cdc 
example in the examples/ folder with the corresponding reverse.client.cdc.
