Currently, the 'junit' target of build.xml doesn't work.

Attachments don't work. In SOAPService.java:
  Message msg = new Message(request.getMessage());
The parameter is only used as the SOAPPart, so
the whole message, with attachments and everything
is put as the SOAPPart, which obviously doesn't
work. There doesn't seem to be a way to construct
an entire Message back from a byte stream/string.
If we use ObjectInput/OutputStrem, it's java specific.
