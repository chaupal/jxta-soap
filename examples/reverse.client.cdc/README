This folder contains ReverseClient example for CDC version of Jxta-Soap; it can be executed
to invoke Reverse service that is deployed by ReverseServer in basic.server.cdc directory.
You have to run the ReverseServer and ReverseClient on different machines 
(or the same machine, but on different ports). 

Both client and server are edge nodes; currently they are configured in multicast mode, 
so no connection to rendezvous node is required.

If multicast is disabled, you have to edit the following line of code:
 
config.addRdvSeedingURI("http://dsg.ce.unipr.it/research/SP2A/rdvlist2.txt"); 

to use your own list of hosts running rendezvous peers 
(which must include the host running the ReverseServer, of course).

Note that both server and client create a private NetPeerGroup (see .jxta/config.properties), 
and the public rendezvous list provided by JXTA official servers is not used.

You can compile and start the client from the reverse.client.cdc folder with the following commands:

ant build
ant run

A clear target is also available in order to clean the project for a new execution:
ant clear
