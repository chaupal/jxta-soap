This folder contains ReverseServer example for CDC version of Jxta-Soap;
a ReverseClient is also available in reverse.client.cdc directory.
You have to run the ReverseServer and ReverseClient on different machines 
(or the same machine, but on different ports). 

The src/ folder contains the server code and a services/ sub-folder with the deployed ReverseService.

Both client and server are edge nodes; currently they are configured in multicast mode, 
so no connection to rendezvous node is required.

If multicast is disabled, you have to edit the following line of code:
 
config.addRdvSeedingURI("http://dsg.ce.unipr.it/research/SP2A/rdvlist2.txt"); 

to use your own list of hosts running rendezvous peers 
(which must include the host running the ReverseServer, of course).

Note that both server and client create a private NetPeerGroup (see .jxta/config.properties), 
and the public rendezvous list provided by JXTA official servers is not used.

You can compile and start the server from the basic.server.cdc folder with the following commands:

ant build
ant run

A clear target is also available in order to clean the project for a new execution:
ant clear
