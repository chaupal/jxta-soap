All three directories contain the HelloService example,
with the following differences:

basic ---> no security

wss ---> message-level security (WSS)

tls ---> transport-level security (TLS)


You have to run the HelloServer and HelloClient on different machines 
(or the same machine, but on different ports). 
The server is configured as a Rendezvous, while the client is an Edge 
and should connect to the former. 

Edit the line of code:

config.addRdvSeedingURI("http://dsg.ce.unipr.it/research/SP2A/rdvlist2.txt"); 

to use your own list of hosts running rendezvous peers 
(which must include the host running the HelloServer, of course).

Note that both server and client create a private NetPeerGroup (see .jxta/config.properties), 
and the public rendezvous list provided by JXTA official servers is not used.
