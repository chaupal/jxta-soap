All three directories contain the HelloServer/HelloClient example,
with the following differences:

basicExample ---> no security

defaultMessage ---> message-level security (WSS)

defaultTransport ---> transport-level security (TLS)


You have to run the HelloServer and HelloClient on different machines. 
The server is configured as a Rendezvous, while the client is an Edge 
and should connect to the former. The XML profiles (rdvProfile.xml and 
edgeProfile.xml) contain a reference to an example rendezvous list:

<rendezVous bootstrap="http://dsg.ce.unipr.it/research/SP2A/exampleRdvList.txt" discovery="false">

Edit this line to use your list of rendezvous (which must include the HelloServer), 
which can also be local to the peers and not online:

<rendezVous bootstrap="file://yourRdvList.txt" discovery="false">

Note that both server and client create a private NetPeerGroup (see .jxta/config.properties), 
and the public rendezvous list provided by JXTA official servers is not used.
