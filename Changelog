-----------------------
Changelog for JXTA-SOAP
-----------------------
All paths relative to soap/binding/java
	

src/net/jxta/soap/bootstrap/JXTABootstrap.java
----------------------------
Changed it so that it automatically bootstraps on first getInstance()


src/net/jxta/soap/bootstrap/AXISBootstrap.java
----------------------------
Changed it so that it automatically bootstraps on first getInstance()


src/net/jxta/soap/jxta/Service.java
-----------------
Added new init() and advertiseModuleSpec() methods that accept an
additional 'param' parameter, which is a StructuredTextDocument
that will be embedded in the ModuleSpecAdvertisment.

Added description field from ServiceDescriptor to advertiseModuleSpec()

Moved over to new Message API in accept(). We use ByteArrayMessageElement.
I tried StringMessageElement but couldn't get it to work properly. Not
sure which we should use. They're pretty interchangeable for our needs.


src/net/jxta/soap/jxta/SOAPService.java
---------------------
Changes to send entire message, not just SOAPPart, which means attachments
will be sent. XML parser chokes on the SwA files as of now though.



src/net/jxta/soap/jxta/transport/JXTATransportSender.java
---------------------------------------
Moved over to new Message API

Changed it so that it sends the entire Request message, not just the SOAPPArt.
This means attachments should work.


src/net/jxta/soap/jxta/CallFactory.java
---------------------
Commented out most of MSAdvertisementComparator because 
ModuleSpecAdvertisement.getLocalExpirationTime() doesn't exist anymore in JXTA.

Refactored createCall() methods and added some new ones with wsdl support.


src/net/jxta/soap/ServiceDescriptor.java
----------------------
Added constructor that takes only ModuleSpecAdvertisement, PeerGroup and
service class name. Useful for clients that do not have the server's
ServiceDescription but need to recreate it from the info they've got.

Changed default timeout to 10000.


src/net/jxta/soap/deploy/DeploySOAPService.java
-----------------------------
Changed WSDD_JAVA to URI_WSDD_JAVA, and changed hard-coded wsdd namespace
to URI_WSDD constant.

Added getService() method with wsdl support.


src/net/jxta/soap/deploy/DeploySOAPTransport.java
-------------------------------
Changed hard-coded namespaces to URI_WSDD_JAVA and URI_WSDD


src/net/jxta/soap/JXTAUtils.java
-------------
Added a toByteArray() method


src/net/jxta/soap/JXTAEngineConfigurationFactory.java
-----------------------------------------------------
This new class added was added to allow WSDL stuff to work.
