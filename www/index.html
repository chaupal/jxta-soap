Important:<br />              1) XML profiles are no more used (we preferred to use the new NetworkConfigurator).<br />             2) Now peers connect to JXTA public NetPeerGroup         </li>         <li>             [16 jan 2006] <strong>Service Life Cycle</strong> has been introduced. The request scope is object (it is the default in Axis),              so for each request the Axis server will create a new xxxService              object and also in each request will call the init() and destroy() methods,              as you can observe in the output of the provided examples.              If the scope was session, then the init() would              be called at the start of the session, and the destroy() would be called              at the end of the session. And if the scope was application, then the              Axis server would create a singleton shared object to service all              requests, call init() in the first request, and call destroy() only if the              Axis server is stopped or the service is undeployed.          </li>         <li>             [22 dec 2005] It is now possible to set a <strong>custom WSDD</strong> for a Web Service to be deployed. This feature             allows, for example, to use complex data types for input/output messages.          </li>         <li>             [18 nov 2005] <strong>WSS</strong> support (<em>i.e.</em> <strong>message-level security</strong>) has been introduced!

JXTA-SOAP no longer performs subgroup creation.              The lib/ directory now contains only useful jars.         </li>          <li>             [2 Sep 2005] The Hello example has been updated, to be compliant with Axis 1.2.1 and JXTA 2.3.4.              Moreover, both service provider and consumer peers now use the Configurator class with XML profiles.         </li>                  <li>             [31 Aug 2005] Libraries (soap/binding/java/lib/) have been updated: now they include              Axis 1.2.1 and JXTA 2.3.4. JXTA-SOAP source code has been updated to be compliant with new libs.             <strong>Java 1.5</strong> and Ant 1.6.5 are used to compile and test the source code.         </li>                           <h2>Technical details</h2>          <p>             Current JXTA-SOAP component release is based on Axis JAX-RPC, an API for the invocation              of Web Services across heterogeneous platforms. A JAX-RPC client can use stubs-based,              dynamic proxy or dynamic invocation interface (DII) programming models to invoke a              heterogeneous Web Service endpoint. JAX-RPC requires SOAP over HTTP for interoperability.              JAX-RPC uses SAAJ API which provides a standard Java API for constructing and manipulating              SOAP messages with attachments. Moreover, JAX-RPC provides support for SOAP message              processing model through the SOAP message handler functionality. This enables developers              to build SOAP specific extensions to support security, logging and any other facilities.              In particular, JXTA-SOAP uses JXTA bidirectional pipes to carry out SOAP messages between              active service instances and remote client peers.          </p>          <h3>JavaDocs</h3>         <p>           <a target="new" href="http://dsg.ce.unipr.it/research/JXTASOAP/javadoc/index.html">JXTA-SOAP JavaDocs</a> 		</p>          <h3>Binaries</h3>         <p>           <a href="http://dsg.ce.unipr.it/research/JXTASOAP/jxta-soap.jar">JXTA-SOAP binaries (J2SE version)</a> 		<br /> 		<a href="http://dsg.ce.unipr.it/research/JXTASOAP/jxtaSoapLibs.zip">external libraries</a> 		</p>          <h3>Service provider peers</h3>                  <p>               Web Service deployment through a JXTA service requires the instantiation of a ServiceDescriptor,              the insertion of the WSDL interface in the &quot;Parm&quot; tag of a JXTA service advertisement (transparently created by JXTA-SOAP),             and the instantiation of a SOAPService in a new Thread. After that, without any additional programming effort,              the service listens for messages on its input pipe, accepts these messages, creates a bidirectional pipe between              the remote client peer, invokes the method on the Web Service implementation,              and then returns the result to the client.          </p>          <p>             <strong>Example:</strong>          </p>                  <pre>            //service descriptor<br />            ServiceDescriptor descriptor = new ServiceDescriptor(className,            <br />                                                                 serviceName,               <br />                                                                 version,             <br />                                                                 creator,             <br />                                                                 specURI, <br />                                                                 description,<br />                                                                 groupID,            <br />                                                                 groupName,           <br />                                                                 groupDescription,   <br />                                                                 securityFlag);            <br />       <br />            // Add WSDL description to Param in ModuleSpecAdv<br />            StructuredTextDocument param = (StructuredTextDocument)<br />                StructuredDocumentFactory.newStructuredDocument(new MimeMediaType(&quot;text/xml&quot;), &quot;Parm&quot;);<br />            String WSDLFile = ... ; // serialized WSDL interface<br />            if (WSDLFile != null) {<br />                Element e = param.createElement(&quot;WSDL&quot;, WSDLFile);<br />                param.appendChild(e);<br />            }<br /><br />            String WSDDFile = ... ; // serialized WSDD <br />            if (WSDDFile != null) {<br />                Element e = param.createElement(&quot;WSDD&quot;, WSDDFile);<br />                param.appendChild(e);<br />            }<br /><br />            //create a new SOAPService instance to use<br />            SOAPService service = new SOAPService();<br /><br />            // initialise the service<br />            service.init(group, descriptor, param, securityPolicy);<br /><br />            // start a new ServiceThread running this service<br />            new ServiceThread(service).start();<br />        </pre>                  <h3>Service consumer peers</h3>          <p>             Service discovery is performed by normal JXTA attribute/value search.              Once the desired service has been found, its methods can be invoked with              <strong>CallFactory.getInstance().createCall()</strong>. This invocation returns             an instance of org.apache.axis.client.Call class, which is JAXRPC DII implementation              of the Call interface, and it is the usual choice for invoking Web Services with the JAXRPC tool.         </p>         <p>             [See: <a href="http://ws.apache.org/axis/java/apiDocs/org/apache/axis/client/Call.html">              http://ws.apache.org/axis/java/apiDocs/org/apache/axis/client/Call.html</a>]         </p>          <p>             The org.apache.axis.client.Call instance is then used to perform remote invocations,             by specifying the method to call and its parameters.         </p>                  <p>             <strong>Example:</strong>          </p>          <pre>            Call call = CallFactory.getInstance().createCall(descriptor, advertisement, peergroup);<br />            <br />            call.setOperationName(new QName(descriptor.getName(), &quot;sayHello&quot;));<br />            call.setTimeout(new Integer(10000));<br />            <br />            String res = (String) call.invoke(new Object[] {&quot;Hey JXTA peer!&quot;});<br />        </pre>                  <p>             CallFactory is a class provided by JXTA-SOAP to create (JAX-RPC) Call objects with the following properties:         </p>          <pre>            call.setTransport(new JXTASOAPTransport());<br />            call.setProperty(&quot;peergroup&quot;, peergroup);<br />            call.setProperty(&quot;advertisement&quot;, advertisement);<br />            call.setProperty(&quot;descriptor&quot;, descriptor);<br />        </pre>                  <h2>Work in progress</h2>              <li>             Is WSRF support a feasible feature?
